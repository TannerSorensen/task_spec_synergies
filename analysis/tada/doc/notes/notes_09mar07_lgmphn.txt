
Issues raised after meeting Friday 9th March
--------------------------------------------

[dors]C-[alv]S clusters not great:
 - TB blending too strongly
 - too narrow so no frication
 - eg. 'scream', 'kingsway'

ordering in clusters:
 - misordered coupling relationships in CCC clusters
 
oscillator names lower case in some files, capitalised in other
 - make this consistent throughout
 
'beta' blending param now deleted from output but still written to <TV_.O>
 - check if needed in Hosung's code, and delete if not
 
version number required on TADA GUI before released externally
 - start with v0.90 for beta release, increment each change v0.91 etc
 
check with Phil Rubin about webpage at Haskins
 - get style sheet
 - prepare basic front page with registration form
 - check ability to download archive through firewall

tongue root gesture:
 - needed for proper spec of R
 - ATR vowels?

version control software:
 - CVS?
 - check for setting up server on hakins
 - client-side s/w?

stand-alone TADA verion
 - haven't fully checked MLC installer and cross-platform independence
 - check for downloadable installer to post with code on website
