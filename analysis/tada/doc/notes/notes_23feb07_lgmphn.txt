
To be tested today:
- test NAR=2 for Y, W, L, ZH, SH
- test NAR=2 for Y, W, L, ZH, SH
- test changed JH: (CLO -1 -> -2 (default), etc)
- test changed CH: (f -> 2 (from default))

To be done later:
- change OSC{W,L} wid -> sgl? dep? mon? aux?
- /R/: test addition of tongue root gesture
!!! - /R/: test oscillator change to 'wid' (sgl? dep? mon? aux?)
- test use of JAW TV for sibilants (Value ~ current jaw position) (ref. frame?)
- relabel vocalic constriction degree.
- Onset cluster in testlist.

- AH doesn't work.
- R doesn't get coupling graph.      fixed in coupling.ph (ons2_rel1 should be ons1_rel1, which is coupled in a way.)
- SH doesn't work. (change TTCD to 1.5 from 2.5, TBCD back to 8)  (seems to work.)

enhancements


test new gen.ph that fixes Y in coda bug    ->>>>> fixed
new version of gest with rules to delete gestures in onset and coda
new version of gest that puts Y in coda for IY, EY, W in coda for UW, OW.
test tense and lax vowels
test that gen_ph will work with new codas that we will generate with revised gest
gen_ph need to work for initial 'h'   ->>>>fixed
test N+stop cluster

LA target is too small for IY (maybe 2->4)
