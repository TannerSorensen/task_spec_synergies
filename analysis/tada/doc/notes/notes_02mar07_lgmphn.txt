
To be done (mike):
- new version of gest with rules to delete gestures in onset and coda
- new version of gest that puts Y in coda for IY, EY, W in coda for UW, OW
- new verions of gest which fixes lateral oscillator list

  then after fixing gest:
- test that gen_ph will work with new codas that we will generate with revised gest
- test tense/lax (back Vs)
- test N+stop cluster
- test all approximants GEST problems resolved:
  - NAR=2 has been used throughout
  - R: release gesture added

To be done (hosung):
- change OSC{W,L,R} wid -> new name
- onset clusters
- test that gen_ph will work with new codas that we will generate with revised gest
- test tense/lax (back Vs)
- ons_h1 HH-initial Hosung issues
- test N+stop cluster
- tadacl more stable



Too Hard Basket:
- /R/: test addition of tongue root gesture
- test use of JAW TV for sibilants (Value ~ current jaw position) (ref. frame?)
- experiment with oral cavity volume: clicks, ejectives; HLSYN:UC 
- alveloar quality to labials because TT is lingering in /AE/ context ('chap')
  (neutral attractor stiffness TT??)
  (jaw weight TT??)
